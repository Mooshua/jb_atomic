👮 A Jailbreak map for CS:GO

| ⚠️ | *Warning:* This version of the map is *decompiled*. The original VMF was deleted early in development and the rest of the map was created from a decompiled version of the original. As such parts of the map may have issues, but these have not cropped up in playtesting.
